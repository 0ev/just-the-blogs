[View it on GitHub](https://github.com/0ev/just-the-blogs){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 }

---

Just the Blogs is a theme for generating static websites with [Jekyll]. You can write source files for your web pages using [Markdown], the [Liquid] templating language, and HTML.[^1] Jekyll builds your site by converting all files that have [front matter] to HTML. Your [Jekyll configuration] file determines which theme to use, and sets general parameters for your site, such as the URL of its home page.

Jekyll builds this Just the Blogs theme docs website using the theme itself. These web pages show how your web pages will look *by default* when you use this theme. But you can easily *[customize]* the theme to make them look completely different!

Browse the docs to learn more about this theme.

If you want to know how to set up and use this theme with all the fancy buttons, spacers and other cool features check out the [Just the Docs repo].
